these note can be deleted and have for goal to compile all needed 
information on bash commands regarding pipe (|)

---------------------------------
cd:
cd doesnt seem to get applied when pipe is found
though it doesn't return any error
---------------------------------
pwd: 
pwd seem to work when disposed as a second argument



---------------------------------
General behaviour
the last command is the one being outputed (except for cd which doesnt
interact at all with pipe)
for commands printing things, it'll execute no matter the place 
if it does not output to standard output

Conclusion:
general application of pipe with the current commands is surprisingly
and suspiciously poor, must be missing some juicy inter-command 
interactions
