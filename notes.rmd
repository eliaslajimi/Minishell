### Notes Pipe behaviours
```{sh}
echo Hello World | echo Bye
echo Hello World >> file1 | echo Bye
```
Notes from these two examples: 
if you have a pipe, in the first instance: the writing end part of the pipe
is not going to output anything the fd 1  

On the second instance, it will execute the writing end part of the pipe which
means it's going to create "file1", and write "Hello World" in it, and it will print out 
the second part to fd 1

```{sh}
env | echo >> Bye
```
In this example, env doesn't get executed, only the second part gets executed.
